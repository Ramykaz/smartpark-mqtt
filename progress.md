# Progress
## v0.7 - 2026-05-03
- Renamed components
## v0.6 - 2026-05-03

- Built a complete PyQt5 desktop dashboard (`ui/`) for real-time parking lot visualisation.
- Added `ui/signals.py`: central `ParkingSignals(QObject)` with four typed signals (`slot_updated`, `summary_updated`, `alert_triggered`, `connected`) used for thread-safe communication between the Paho MQTT thread and the Qt main thread.
- Added `ui/widgets/slot_cell.py`: `SlotCell(QFrame)` widget — 90×70 px cell displaying slot ID and state, color-coded by state (FREE/OCCUPIED/RESERVED/REQUESTING), emits `reserve_requested` signal on left-click when FREE.
- Added `ui/widgets/slot_grid.py`: `SlotGrid(QWidget)` that lays out N SlotCells in a `ceil(sqrt(N))`-column grid, exposes `update_slot()` and forwards `reserve_requested` upward.
- Added `ui/widgets/summary_panel.py`: `SummaryPanel(QFrame)` showing live FREE / OCCUPIED / RESERVED counts in a horizontal bar.
- Added `ui/widgets/alert_banner.py`: `AlertBanner(QLabel)` red banner shown when occupancy exceeds 90%, hidden by default.
- Added `ui/dashboard.py`: `ParkingDashboard(QMainWindow)` wiring all widgets together, managing its own Paho MQTT client (subscribes to `parking/telemetry/+` and `parking/system/#`), and publishing RESERVE commands on slot click.
- Added `ui/main.py`: CLI entry point with `--slots`, `--broker`, `--port` arguments; generates zero-padded slot IDs matching the simulator's naming convention.
- Fixed platform plugin resolution: set `QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH` before `QApplication` loads to point at the bundled PyQt5 cocoa plugin.

## v0.5 - 2026-04-18

- Added `tests/test_integration_basic.py`, a standalone end-to-end check that runs the real subscriber with SQLite logging enabled and 3 real slot simulators against the (run this on your host before running the test) Mosquitto broker on `localhost:1883`.
- The script lets the system run briefly, then verifies the `received` table contains rows for all 3 slots with valid `msg_id` format, non-duplicate deliveries, and `recv_ts >= sent_ts`.

## v0.4 - 2026-04-18

- Made `MeasurementLogger` opt-in in the subscriber: `subscriber.start()` now accepts `enable_logging=False` (default) and only creates the logger, opens a SQLite connection, and registers the `record` handler when explicitly enabled.
- `ExperimentController` passes `enable_logging=True` to preserve existing behavior.

## v0.3 - 2026-04-18

- Added configurable experiment controls for `base_seed`, per-slot jitter, and simulator mode (`random` or `forced`) so runs can be reproducible or intentionally high-throughput.
- Changed the experiment runner and shared config model to carry the new timing/behavior settings through to each slot simulator instance.
- Changed the slot simulator to rely on shared protocol constants/builders, use per-slot seeded RNG, and publish transition-driven state updates with jittered timing instead of tightly synchronized behavior.
- Fixed simulator lockstep risk by desynchronizing slots while still allowing full-run reproducibility from a single base seed.
